The Manjaro community is proud to present another update to the Gnome Edition installation media.

This release keeps to the style of the 15.09 release being that it is highly vanilla, but of course is up-to-date at the time of build and includes the latest Manjaro back-end infrastructure. Note this means a very vanilla Gnome configuration, it doesn't mean 'minimal', the full set of Gnome software and other apps are provided out-of-the-box.

This release is produced based on the [2nd of October stable branch update](https://manjaro.github.io/Update-2015-10-02_(stable)/), a few highlights:

* Gnome 3.16.7
* Linux kernel 4.1.9 LTS
* systemd 226
* Xorg-server 1.17.2+fixes
* Mesa 11.0.2
* Firefox 41.0.2

Further updates for some of these components are already available in our respositories.
