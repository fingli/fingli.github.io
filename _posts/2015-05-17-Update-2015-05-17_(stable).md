title: Manjaro Update 2015-05-17 (stable)
---

We are happy to announce our **ninth** update for Manjaro 0.8.12.

We are getting really close to our next stable release. Therefor we released [Manjaro 0.8.13-rc1](https://manjaro.github.io/Manjaro-0.8.13-rc1-released/) today. Most changes went into our graphical installer Thus and our tools. With this update we have new Kernels, Gnome 3.16.2, KDE Apps 15.04.1, Libreoffice 4.4.3 Calligra 2.9.4 and a more fixed QT 5.4.1. Also Virtualbox is now at 4.3.28. Steam got updated to 1.0.0.50 (Native client might not work).

As normal, this update includes also regular Archlinux upstream fixes (Sun May 17 09:40:06 CEST 2015).

Please give us feedback and report any findings with this update.

Kind regards,
Philip MÃ¼ller and the Manjaro Development Team
