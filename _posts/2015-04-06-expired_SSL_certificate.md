title: Expired SSL certificate
---

Oops! We didn't update our SSL certificate before it expired. This means you will get a warning in your web browser when you try to access our wiki or forum.

We were already working on getting a new SSL certificate - please bear with us. We are waiting on the issuer (GlobalSign) to respond.

Until then, if you use Firefox you can try a 'private window' which may allow you to add an exception to ignore the expired certificate. You could also try a different web browser, as different browsers treat the issue in different ways.

Kind regards,

Philip MÃ¼ller, Manjaro Development Team
