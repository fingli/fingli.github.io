title: Manjaro Update 2015-04-21 (stable)
---

We are happy to announce our **seventh** update for Manjaro 0.8.12.

Gnome 3.16 is now avaiable. It took us a while to get most of the issues fixed. Thx flies out to **Horst3180** for adding gtk316 compatibility to Menda. Gnome brings new features and functions. Some you might notice right away, like hidden scrollbars when you don't need them and visual signals when you hit the end of a file. Other features are more hidden ;)

David is working on Maia, the new theme for our upcoming Manjaro Plasma5 Edt. Maia icons supporting now also XFCE.

Ramon and I are working hard on our graphical installer Thus to get ready for our next stable release of Manjaro, 0.8.13. Most of the issues are solved. We are still hoping on some translations, as with the rework and adding of new features lot of strings had changed. So hit over to transifex and start translating ;)

Guillaume worked on pamac. With release 2.3 we added some fixes and features to our engine. Also pamac supports now GTK 3.16.

Arnt added some needed functions and features to octopi. We released his latest work as version 0.7rc2.

Kernel-wise we added Linux 4.0 and updated other kernels as usual.

With this update you find also regular updates like:

mhwd-0.5.4, maia-theme 0.3.2, gambas 3.7.1, calligra 2.9.2, nvidia 346.59, libreoffice 4.4.2, gnome 3.16.1, KDE Frameworks 5.9, octopi 0.7rc2 and pamac 2.3.

As regular, this update includes also regular Archlinux upstream fixes (Sun Apr 19 09:26:19 CEST 2015).

Please give us feedback and report any findings with this update.

Kind regards,
Philip MÃ¼ller and the Manjaro Development Team
