title: Manjaro Update 2015-07-13 (stable)
---

We are happy to announce our **fourth update** for Manjaro 0.8.13.

We added some **patches to Calamares 1.1.1** pushed some regular updates, released **Catalyst 15.20.1046**, **Calligra 2.9.6**, **flashplugin 11.2.202.481** and added **new features to Octopi 0.7.0**, updated **thunderbird**, most of our kernels and pushed 
out **Plasma 5.12**.

This update pack comes also with **manjaro-tools 0.9.11** which mostly fixes or 
adds new features to buildiso:

* updates manjaro-chroot help
* updates profile structure
* mount fixes for a Windows issue
* add some rudimentary lvm support
* mark openrc install medias with extra tag
* add support for non manjaro branding
* fix ownership of generated files by buildiso

As regular, this update includes also regular Archlinux upstream fixes (Mon Jul 13 19:53:15 CEST 2015).

It is always good to check for updated packages, even we don't notify you about them. As usual people using our testing branch will help us to get snaps over to our stable branch almost smoothly. For notifications on daily bases please take a look at our [mailing list](https://lists.manjaro.org/pipermail/manjaro-packages/).


Please give us feedback and report any findings with this update.

Kind regards,
Philip MÃ¼ller and the Manjaro Development Team
