title: Manjaro Update 2015-08-31 (stable)
---

We are happy to announce our **eleventh** update for Manjaro 0.8.13.

With this we updated **Plasma** to **5.4**, **KDE-Apps** to **15.08**, **nvidia** to **352.41**, **libreoffice** to **5.0.1**, **firefox** to **40.0.3**, **linux** to **3.12.47** and **4.2-rc8**.

Beside small fixes to our Maia theme we fixed some openrc related packages, worked on our Calamares development package, released **pamac 2.4.1** and **octopi 0.7.1** with additional features. Also we ship the usual Archlinux upstream fixes (Mon Aug 31 07:18:45 CEST 2015).

It is always good to check for updated packages, even we don't notify you about them. As usual people using our testing branch will help us to get snaps over to our stable branch almost smoothly. For notifications on daily bases please take a look at our [mailing list](https://lists.manjaro.org/pipermail/manjaro-packages/).

Please give us feedback and report any findings with this update.

Kind regards,
Philip MÃ¼ller and the Manjaro Development Team
