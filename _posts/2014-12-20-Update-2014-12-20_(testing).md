title: Manjaro Update - 2014-12-20 (testing)
---

We are happy to announce our third update review cycle for Manjaro 0.8.11.

With this update we present **Plasma 5.1.2**, **systemd 2.18** and updated **menda-icons**. **Calamares 0.17.5-2** introduces a new way to install [Manjaro 0.9.0-dev](http://sourceforge.net/projects/manjarotest/files/0.9.0/) and we modified grub2 to load early microcodes for your CPUs (currently working with linux318 only).

Also we updated some of our kernels (3.10.63, 3.13.11.13, 3.14.27, 3.17.7 and 3.18.1). All of them ship **BFQ v7r6** and include needed fixes and enhancements.

Beside fixes for our **compiz packages**, we ship regular Arch-Upstream updates (Sat Dec 20 11:01:42 CET 2014). This includes updates to haskell, perl, virtual box, glibc, thunderbird and php.

Please give us feedback and report any findings with this update.

kind regards

the Manjaro Development Team

###Troubleshoots

The 3.15 series Linux kernel is no longer supported. If you get any errors when trying to update that relate to a package with **linux315** in the name, the solution is to remove all **linux315 packages** from your system. You can easily do this through the Manjaro Settings Manager.
