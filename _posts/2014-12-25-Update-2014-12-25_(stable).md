title: Manjaro Update 2014-12-25 (stable)
---

We are happy to announce our third update for Manjaro 0.8.11.

With this update we present **Plasma 5.1.2**, **systemd 2.18** and updated **menda-icons**. **Calamares 0.17.5-2** introduces a new way to install [Manjaro 0.9.0-dev](http://sourceforge.net/projects/manjarotest/files/0.9.0/) and we modified **grub2** to load early microcodes for your CPUs (currently working with linux310, 317 & 318 only).

Also we updated some of our kernels (3.10.63, 3.13.11.13, 3.14.27, 3.17.7 and 3.18.1). All of them ship BFQ v7r6 and include needed fixes and enhancements.

Beside fixes for our compiz packages, we ship regular Arch-Upstream updates (Wed Dec 24 07:33:40 CET 2014). This includes updates to haskell, perl, virtualbox, glibc, gambas3, libreoffice-fresh, thunderbird and php.

Please give us feedback and report any findings with this update.

kind regards

the Manjaro Development Team
