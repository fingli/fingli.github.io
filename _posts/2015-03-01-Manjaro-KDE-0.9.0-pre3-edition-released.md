Almost one month passed since our last preview of our next stable release, Manjaro 0.9.0.

With this new release of Plasma 5 providing a visually updated core desktop experience that is easy to use and familiar to the user. Changes under the hood of KDE include the migration to a new, fully hardware-accelerated graphics stack centered around an OpenGL(ES) scenegraph. Plasma is built using Qt 5 and Frameworks 5. Plasma 5.2.0 introduces a new major version of KDE's workspace offering. The Manjaro Art Team has forked the new KDE Breeze set and named it Menda to follow in line with the rest of our visually appealing desktops, this artwork concept introduces cleaner visuals and improved readability.

We worked also hard to improve our graphical installer Calamares and our system tools to make the installation and usage of Manjaro as easy and smooth as possible.

**New features and enhancements**

- **BlueDevil**: a range of desktop components to manage Bluetooth devices. It'll set up your mouse, keyboard, send & receive files and you can browse for devices.
- **KSSHAskPass**: if you access computers with ssh keys but those keys have passwords this module will give you a graphical UI to enter those passwords.
- **Login theme configuration (SDDM)**: SDDM is now the login manager of choice for Plasma and this new System Settings module allows you to configure the theme.
- **KScreen**: getting its first release for Plasma 5 is the System Settings module to set up multiple monitor support.
- **GTK Application Style**: this new module lets you configure themeing of applications from Gnome.
- **KDecoration**: this new library makes it easier and more reliable to make themes for KWin, Plasma's window manager. It has impressive memory, performance and stability improvements.
