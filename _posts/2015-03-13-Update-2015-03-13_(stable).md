title: Manjaro Update 2015-03-13 (stable)
---

We are happy to announce our **fourth update** for Manjaro 0.8.12.

This time we are shipping the latest beta driver from AMD: **Catalyst 15.200**. Why? It is simple. It supports Xorg-Server 1.17-series. So we updated to the latest **xorg-server 1.17.1** package and all additional video drivers.

**XFCE 4.12 desktop** got updated to final release with our additional patches. **KDE Apps** is now at **14.12.3**, **KDE** to **4.14.6** and **Plasma** to **5.2.1**. New point-releases for some of our kernel-series we included in this update cycle.

Most of our work went into our tools. **manjaro-tools 0.9.7** is ready now! It ships now with branding support and is now more flexible than before.

**Pamac 2.2** got tuned under the hood. User won't see any changes at first sight. However we need still your support for translating our tools.

Game-wise we updated steam to get even more support on our OS. Last but not least we can welcome **David Linares** (mcder3) to our artwork team. Check out his new Maia theme he is doing for our Plasma 5 edition of Manjaro Linux!

Some updates to mention: firefox 36.0.1, xfce 4.12.0, linux310 3.10.71, linux314 3.14.35, linux316 3.16.7.8, linux318 3.18.9, linux319 3.19.1, virtualbox 4.3.24, calligra 2.9.0, plasma5-themes-maia 0.2.0, catalyst 15.200, libreoffice-fresh 4.4.1, steam-manjaro 1.0.0.49, kde-apps 14.12.3, kde 4.14.6, plasma 5.2.1

This includes also regular Archlinux upstream fixes (Mar 13 17:46:31 CET 2015) Please give us feedback and report any findings with this update.

Kind regards,
Manjaro Development Team
