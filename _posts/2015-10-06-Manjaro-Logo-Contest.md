title: Manjaro Logo Contest
---

<img src="https://manjaro.github.io/images/drafts.jpg">

Manjaro will get some great innovations soon and maybe also a new logo. We are asking our great community to help us choose a new design. If you are a designer or you have some graphical skills, please feel free to propose a logo draft. Help us and send us great logos, ideas and choose your favourite designs.

Although the inspiration for the name originates from Mount Kilimanjaro. Maybe we can include a mountain into the new logo as we already tried in our drafts.

So get creative. You can either post your work in our forum or mail it to **support@manjaro.org**. The contest will take place till **14.10.2015 18:00 CEST**.
