The Manjaro community is proud to present a new Manjaro JWM Edition installation media.

JWM (Joe's Window Manager) is a lightweight stacking window manager for the X Window System written by Joe Wingbermuehle. JWM is written in C and uses only Xlib at a minimum. Configuration is by editing an XML file - no graphical configuration is supplied.

To make it much easier to use this window manager, Holmes from Manjaro Brasil decided to create another nice install media for Manjaro Linux. It features our well-known tools and graphical interfaces in a mix of fresh artwork from our community.

* 4.1 LTS Kernel
