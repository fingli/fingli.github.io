title: Manjaro Update - 2015-01-08 (testing)
---

We are happy to announce our fifth review cycle for Manjaro 0.8.11.

With this update we have **pacman 4.2**, **pamac 2.1**, **package-query 1.5** and **pyalpm 0.7**. Also we can present **kodi 14.0**, which replaces XBMC. Beside the change to pacman 4.2, we have our **first stable release of manjaro-tools** - a replacment for manjaroiso and devtools. Some of our developers are already testing these new tools. If you like, test them too. We have a great [wiki documentation](url=https://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php?title=Manjaro-tools) for it.

**Please use pacman for updating.** We also want to know, if Octopi still works.

This includes also regular Archlinux upstream fixes (**Jan 8 19:21:52 CET 2015**). 
Please give us feedback and report any findings with this update.

kind regards

the Manjaro Development Team
