title: Manjaro Update -  2014-12-19 (stable)
---

We are happy to announce our second update after our release of Manjaro 0.8.11.

With this update we fixed some issues with Bluedevil and devices powered-off by default:

<https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=341546>
<https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=337193>

Also we updated some of our kernels (3.10.62, 3.12.35, 3.14.26, 3.17.6) and introduce the 3.18 series. Along with usual upstream fixes and enhancements, all these kernels include BFQ v7r6, which improves boot time while retaining it's usual responsiveness. More info here:

On the driver side we updated nvidia-340xx packages. Also there is a new AMD Catalyst driver out there. For more details take a look here:

Beside fixes for our graphical package managers, we ship regular Arch-Upstream updates. This includes updates to Mesa, LibreOffice, Qt5, Python2, Xorg-Server and much more.

This update also includes a number of 'fast-tracked' security fixes.

Please give us feedback and report any issues with this update.

kind regards

the Manjaro Development Team

###Troubleshoots

The 3.15 series Linux kernel is no longer supported. If you get any errors when trying to update that relate to a package with **linux315** in the name, the solution is to remove all **linux315 packages** from your system. You can easily do this through the Manjaro Settings Manager.
