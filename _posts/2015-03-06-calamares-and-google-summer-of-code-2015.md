---

[KDE](http://kde.org) has been [accepted](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org2/google/gsoc2015/kde) as a mentoring organization for Google Summer of Code 2015, and the KDE Student Programs team has kindly granted Calamares the opportunity to participate under the KDE umbrella.

Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is an annual program, first held in 2005, in which Google awards stipends (of US$5,500, as of 2014) to all students who successfully complete a requested open source software coding project during the summer.

We expect to be able to mentor one or two students this summer, depending on the proposals we get. Some project ideas for Calamares have been added to the KDE Google Summer of Code 2015 [Ideas page](https://community.kde.org/GSoC/2015/Ideas#Calamares).

Prospective students should read the KDE Google Summer of Code [Instructions for students](https://community.kde.org/GSoC), choose one or more ideas, and prepare a project proposal. Project proposals should be structured as described in [this article](http://teom.org/blog/kde/how-to-write-a-kick-ass-proposal-for-google-summer-of-code/).

If you're a student and you wish to work on Calamares this summer, be sure to start working on your proposal now, and get feedback from the Calamares team before applying. Feel free to drop by #calamares on Freenode to say hi.
