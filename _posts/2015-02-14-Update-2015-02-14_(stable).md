title: Manjaro Update 2015-02-14 (stable)
---

We are happy to announce our **first update** for Manjaro 0.8.12.

With this update we added **KDE 4.14.5** and **KDE Apps 14.12.2**. **Mesa** got updated to **10.4.4** and now supports DirectX 9. Kernel-wise we have **3.10.68**, **3.12.37**, **3.13.11.15**, **3.14.32**, **3.16.7.5**, **3.18.6** and **3.19.0** featuring all **BFQ-Scheduler v7r7**.

Note: 3.17-series is EOL and will be removed from our repositories soon.

This update also features **NetworkManager 1.0.0**, which fixes some issues we had with our last updates regarding openrc. We are sorry for blocking your updates. Note: The lib32 version bundled with steam-native is still version frozen until tests show that it will not cause instability.

With this update we added the needed **flashplugin 11.2.202.442** update. **Plasma 5** got updated to 5.2 version. **Firefox** is now at **35.0.1**. We also released a bugfix release of **Pamac 2.1**-series. **LXQT got** updated to **0.9** and uses QT5 now.

This includes also regular Archlinux upstream fixes (**Feb 9 10:51:41 CET 2015**).
Please give us feedback and report any findings with this update.

We also include various security fixes for various packages, including Chromium.

Kind regards,
Manjaro Development Team
